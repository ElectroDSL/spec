# ElectroDSL Introduction

## Version

ElectroDSL Introduction v0.1

Status: Draft Specification

---

# 1. Overview

ElectroDSL is a modern, AI-friendly, open language for describing electrical schematics.

It provides a common text-based format that allows engineers, software developers, CAD systems, and artificial intelligence systems to create and exchange electrical designs.

ElectroDSL is designed to be:

- Human-readable
- Machine-readable
- Vendor-neutral
- Version-control friendly
- AI compatible
- Extensible

---

# 2. The Problem

Electrical engineering relies heavily on software tools for creating schematics.

Examples include:

- Electrical CAD systems
- Industrial automation tools
- Building design software
- PCB design tools
- Simulation environments

However, most existing systems use proprietary file formats.

This creates several challenges:

- Designs are locked to specific software
- Collaboration between different tools is difficult
- Long-term accessibility is uncertain
- Automated processing is difficult
- AI systems cannot easily understand proprietary formats

A universal electrical schematic language is needed.

---

# 3. The Vision

The vision of ElectroDSL is:

> To become the open language for electrical schematics.

Similar to how:

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| HTML | Describes web pages |
| Markdown | Describes documents |
| JSON | Describes structured data |
| SVG | Describes graphics |
| ElectroDSL | Describes electrical systems |

ElectroDSL files should become a common exchange format between engineers, applications, and intelligent systems.

# 4. What ElectroDSL Is

ElectroDSL is: 

## A Language

A defined syntax for describing electrical systems.

Example:
COMPONENT Q1 : BREAKER
COMPONENT M1 : MOTOR
CONNECT Q1.OUT -> M1.IN

---

## An Exchange Format

Different applications can exchange designs using:
example.edsl


---

## An AI-Friendly Representation

AI systems can generate, understand, and modify electrical designs using ElectroDSL.

Example:

User:

"Create a three-phase motor starter circuit."

AI:

Generates valid ElectroDSL code.

---

# 5. What ElectroDSL Is Not

ElectroDSL is not:

- A replacement for CAD software
- A drawing application
- A simulation engine
- A proprietary format
- Controlled by one company

The reference editor is only one implementation.

The specification is the standard.

---

# 6. Design Approach

ElectroDSL follows a semantic-first approach.

The file describes:

- Components
- Connections
- Electrical relationships
- Properties
- Design intent

The renderer decides:

- Symbol appearance
- Layout
- Colors
- Page arrangement

This allows the same design to be displayed in different ways.

---

# 7. Example Applications

ElectroDSL can describe:

## Building Electrical

Examples:

- Lighting systems
- Distribution boards
- Protection systems
- Power outlets

---

## Industrial Systems

Examples:

- Motor control
- PLC systems
- Automation panels
- Instrumentation

---

## Marine Electrical Systems

Examples:

- Ship power distribution
- Navigation systems
- Control circuits
- Alarm systems

---

## Biomedical Engineering

Examples:

- Medical equipment connections
- Laboratory systems
- Hospital electrical infrastructure

---

# 8. Target Users

ElectroDSL is designed for:

## Electrical Engineers

To exchange designs independent of software.

## Software Developers

To build tools around a standard format.

## CAD Vendors

To support open interoperability.

## Researchers

To develop AI and automation systems.

## Educators

To teach electrical concepts using transparent designs.

---

# 9. File Format

ElectroDSL files use the extension:


.edsl


Example: motor-starter.edsl

Files are:

- UTF-8 encoded
- Plain text
- Human readable
- Suitable for version control
